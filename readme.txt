Keep track of plugins you activate or deactivate through the dashboard by viewing when each and every one of them was enabled or disabled.

== Description ==

Keep track of plugins you activate or deactivate through the dashboard by viewing when each and every one of them was enabled or disabled.

This plugin allows storing plugin status tracker records for 60 days. Site administrator can customize the duration as their requirements.

Current features:

* Adds new columns on the plugins dashboard screen that shows when each plugin was activated and deactivated with author name and IP address.
* Supported on multisite.
* Control whether you'd like to see a relative date or a "regular" date as set under Settings > General

While by default the date & time settings are being used, you can always change the date format by filtering 'pat_date_time_format_gwl'. For instance:

`<?php

add_filter( 'pat_date_time_format_gwl', 'my_pat_date_time_format_gwl' );
function my_pat_date_time_format_gwl( $date_format ) {
	return 'm-d-Y';
}
`
